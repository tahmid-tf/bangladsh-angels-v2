        <p>The active memberships below are available for purchase online.

        <h2>Electronic delivery</h2>
        <p>Membership is activated after successful payment confirmation, typically within 24 hours. If manual review is needed, including additional linked Institutional accounts, activation may take up to 2 business days.</p>
        <p>Member benefits depend on the selected plan and applicable account or data-room approvals. If access has not been activated within 2 business days, contact {{ config('business.email') }} with your transaction reference.</p>
        <h2>Before you purchase</h2>
        <p>Membership pays for BAN’s services; it is not an investment in a fund or startup. BAN does not pool member capital or provide investment advice. Startup investments are high-risk and may be lost in full.</p>
        <p>For eligibility, refund timelines, and cancellation details, read the linked policies before checkout.</p>
